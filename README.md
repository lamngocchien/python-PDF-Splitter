After marking split points, users select an output directory to save split PDF files.
The PDF is split at the chosen markers, generating separate PDF files.
Open Output Folder:

After splitting, users can directly open the output folder from the application interface.
Key Components and Libraries:

GUI built with customtkinter (dark mode, modern UI).
PDF rendering and manipulation using fitz (PyMuPDF).
Image processing via PIL (Pillow) for page previews and thumbnails.
The script can be packaged into a standalone executable using the provided PyInstaller command:


Copy code
pyinstaller --onefile --noconsole --hidden-import fitz --hidden-import PIL --hidden-import customtkinter smart_pdf.py --name "PDF-Splitter_1.0.exe"
This produces a single executable file that runs without showing a command-line window.
